                     all agree on that, right?But Pennywise, the dancing clown who tracks 
                     down and torments the children of small-town (Derry)Maine in “It,” is deeply unsettling.
                      What if the clown start to frighten the group of teens called 'Loser Club' , how will end between their fight? </br>

                     the Losers Club get the dreaded call to return to Derry (their howntown)and finish what they started.

                <h3><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    My Name is a brilliant take on Action/Thriller involving gangsters, a woman seeking for vengeance and the hunt for the mole.
                     The action sequences are done superbly and Han So Hee did a tremendous job with her part.
                  My Name is abit different than other K Dramas, but it is definitely
                   filled with amazing action and outstanding OST. It felt like every beat
                    matched perfectly with the given scene, which made the overall show compelling and worth watching.

                 My review :  This movie gives me a big self -confident about myself and it also gives the motivation by watching the main female character try so hard to reach the goal of her to find the real killer of her father!

                    The structure of Sweet Home, based on a comic of the same name by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, 
                 is more or less the same as many of the post-apocalyptic shows we have seen in recent years.
                  We are introduced to a group of disparate personalities, all of whom have their own struggles in their lives, 
                  and then the zombies or monsters or whatever mutant life forms threaten the remainder of humanity show up.
                  Then these strangers have to band together and figure out how to survive. So how will this one distinguish itself?
